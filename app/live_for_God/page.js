      <h1>Living For God</h1>
      <p>Once you are saved by the blood of Christ you can get babtized but the most important thing to do once you are saved is to live for the lord.  Colossians:23-24 says, "23 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, 24 since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."  So whatever you do, do it for the lord.</p>
